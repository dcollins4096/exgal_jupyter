    "A computer is able to do dumb things very fast, while a person is able to do smart things very slowly.  I think Feynman said that.  A computer can do the following things; add, subtract, multiply, divide, compare bits, store bits, and retrieve bits.  That's basically it.  In order to do things like make simultions of galaxies forming, we need a way to interact with it.  I speak English, so I want something that looks basically like English.  The computer speaks in 1s and 0s (binary), so we need a translator.  Code is the English-looking bit, and the **compiler** is the translator.  In many languages like C, C++, or Fortran, you write a file filled with code, give the file to a compiler that translates it to machine instructions, and produces an executable file.  Other languages, like Python, are interpreted.  This means there's an interface that does the compiling on-the-fly.  \n",

    "Most code texts and courses start with _data types_, which is the most basic list of kinds of variables one can use.  Originally, the data type referred primarily to the memory needs for a variable.  For example: ```integers``` need 32 bits and store integers (e.g. +1 or -478); ```floats``` have decimal points (e.g. 1.5, $1.05\\times10^{-27}$); charachters are only one byte; ```Arrays``` can sore many pieces of data of a given type, and an array of size N of type T need enough memory allocated (e.g. 128\\* 32 bits, for an array of 128 integers).  In many languages, the programmer declares an element as a type and it stays that way. So for example in the language C, I can make a charachter string, ```name``` and a float ```size```,\n",

    "```\n",
    "string name = \"Matt Pike\";\n",
    "float size = 9000.1;\n",

    "In many languages, these variables are fixed to be those types, and the things I can do with those variables is also fixed.  For example, I can print both of them.  I can add to the size, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "size = size + 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but I can't add to the string name, because adding an integer to a string isn't defined by the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, on the other hand, types things dynamically.  So I don't need to declare what type it is, the interpreter just sorts it out.  This is a blessing and a curse; it make the code easier to read and write, but also makes it easier to make confusing mistakes.  Further, many types have the basic operations like addition (`+`) and multiplication (`*`) _overloaded_ so they do things that make sense.  Read this example and think about what it will do, then hit shitf-enter and see:"
